                    <span>My name is Marcelo J. Carena, I was born in Argentina, and I have been a plant breeder representing the public and private sectors for almost 30 years, most of the time serving as professor and maize breeding unit leader at North Dakota State University. I have a B.S. in Agronomy (1987-1991) from Argentina, a MS in Plant Breeding (1992-1995) from Europe, and a Ph.D. in Plant Breeding (1996-1999) from Iowa State University in the USA. From 1999 to 2017, I led the NDSU maize breeding and genetics research program. My Previous Work: The program was worldwide known for being the most northern public maize breeding program in North America, moving maize north to cooler seasons and west to dry areas. During that time my students and I developed over 90 unique short-season germ plasm, lines, and hybrids with PVP and innovation awards.<br> It was the only maize breeding program in the USA fully funded by grower organizations receiving royalties and fees from products still being commercialized today. I also managed the North Dakota Hybrid Corn Performance Testing (HCPT) program for the state while developing national and worldwide capacity building and plant genetic resources IP policies representing the USDA at the United Nations. My program has challenged agricultural dilemmas to develop the next generation of sustainable cultivars, bridging the missing link between industry and farmers. I currently serve as senior adviser and contractor for breeding project reviews and guidance as well as trainer worldwide. <br>
                    I led several national public-private programs with focus on genetic diversity research, adapting tropical genetic materials to shorter world seasons. The breeding program has developed not only products but also non-destructive methods for high throughput phenotyping of genetically complex traits, difficult to measure, and highly influenced by the environment, which helped mitigate climate changes and has saved millions of dollars to industry and farmers (e.g., AUDDC for fast dry down and BRACE for drought tolerance).</span>
