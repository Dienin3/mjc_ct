              <span class="home-text12 paragraph">
                <span>My name is Marcelo J. Carena,</span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  I have worked both as an academic leader, and as a teacher, in
                  various Universities and Organizations. As an academic leader,
                  I've always been people-oriented and achievement focused
                  working with the education of students and mentoring faculty
                  colleagues for teaching practice and research direction.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  My commitment to teaching and learning has been continuous for
                  over 20 years, and I have over 30 years of experience in the
                  Ag business. I have continuously applied innovative approaches
                  to teaching methods and practice in support of teaching
                  excellence.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  I established unique content and teaching techniques in the
                  area of plant sciences by considering the diversity of the
                  student population and my active participation in teaching
                  circles and national teaching associations.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  I enjoyed tertiary teaching for a long time and still, after
                  so many years, it lifts my spirit when I lecture, most
                  recently virtually for a tertiary course at the University of
                  Buenos Aires during COVID-19 last year.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  I have been a strong learner with the customer always in mind
                  when marketing education and I would like to share my
                  experiences to those around me, and my students, by
                  challenging them with unique ideas.

                  I have authored hundreds of peer-reviewed publications, books,
                  book chapters, and conference papers, many as invited plenary
                  lectures and awards. Books have pre-empted national and
                  international needs with back covers often been dedicated to
                  those that envision the development of the next generation of
                  healthier and sustainable cultivars with less need of
                  fertilizer and water. I have served as unique University
                  elected representative and member at several national and
                  international organizations. I have also served as elected
                  Chair and Secretary of many Committees, the United Nations,
                  the European Association of Plant Breeders (EUCARPIA), the
                  American Seed Trade Association (ASTA), the United States
                  Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Advisory Committee for
                  an AFRI Education program, and the American Societies of Crop
                  Science and Agronomy.

                  I've represented the academia as Senior Editor of the
                  book series “Handbook of Plant Breeding” for U.S., European,
                  Chinese, and South American Editorials, as elected Technical
                  Editor of European Journal of Plant Breeding (Euphytica),
                  Editorial Board member of International Journal of Maize and
                  Allied Species (Maydica), among others. In Euphytica, he has
                  made editorial decisions for over 300 peer-review manuscripts
                  between 2001 and 2020 and now he is working with Springer,
                  Frontiers, and Genes Editorials. In addition, I have
                  represented DLF and AgResearch in industry management teams
